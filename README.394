                        Regina  3.9.4
                       25 October 2021

Changes in this release (from 3.9.3)
------------------------------------
  * Fix for bug #543, #550, #566,
  * Fix for bug #450; breakage under Windows; daylight savings time is already included
    in localtime calculations
  * Added "CALLER" as valid environment for VALUE BIF.
  * Enabled GETCALLSTACK to display to stderr if no stem argument specified
  * Rearranged build process. Package builds now self-contained
  * Add syshomedirectory() in regutil to get user's home directory
  * Add sysgetline() and sysgetlinehistory() in regutil to provide an interface to readline.
    This provides the ability to obtain keyboard line entry with editing and history.
    Requires readline development package installed.
  * When calling UNAME('S') under Windows 11, it will return "WIN10" as the system version.
    This is Microsoft's idea of version control!  To distinguish between Windows 10 and 11
    check that UNAME('R') is 21996 or greater.
