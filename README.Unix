                              Regina 3.4 binaries

This archive contains pre-compiled binaries of Regina 3.3.  The directory
structure is set up to unpack into a base directory such as /usr or /usr/local.

Regina is distributed under the GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. See
COPYING-LIB for details.

On most platforms, it is necessary to include the directory where the shared
libraries (including *.so|.sl|.a) reside; eg /usr/local/lib, to the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

Under AIX this environment variable is LIBPATH.

Under HP-UX this environment variable is SHLIB_PATH.

Under SGI this seems to be LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH.
